# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing OrcamentForm component to improve user experience and code maintainability. The enhancement includes making contact fields mandatory, adding a toggle to enable/disable file upload functionality, including a parts quantity field for better order specification, and refactoring the component following SOLID principles for better separation of concerns and reusability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user filling out the orcament form, I want contact fields to be mandatory and a toggle to enable file upload when needed, so that I can provide essential contact information and optionally include files to support my request.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the form loads THEN the contact fields SHALL be marked as required
2. WHEN the form loads THEN the file upload toggle SHALL be unchecked by default
3. WHEN a user toggles the "enable file upload" checkbox THEN the file upload section SHALL become visible
4. WHEN the toggle is unchecked THEN the file upload section SHALL be hidden
5. WHEN the form is submitted with empty required contact fields THEN the system SHALL display validation errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user requesting an orcament, I want to specify the number of parts I need, so that I can get accurate pricing for my order quantity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the form loads THEN a "number of parts" field SHALL be displayed with a default value of 1
2. WHEN a user enters a number in the parts field THEN the system SHALL accept only positive integers
3. WHEN a user leaves the parts field empty THEN the system SHALL default to 1 part
4. WHEN the form is submitted THEN the parts quantity SHALL be included in the form data
5. IF the parts quantity is less than 1 THEN the system SHALL display a validation error

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want the form components to follow SOLID principles and be properly separated, so that the code is more maintainable and reusable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the code THEN the SubmitButton SHALL be extracted to its own component file
2. WHEN reviewing the code THEN contact information fields SHALL be extracted to a separate component
3. WHEN reviewing the code THEN the parts quantity field SHALL be implemented as a reusable component
4. WHEN reviewing the code THEN each component SHALL have a single responsibility
5. WHEN reviewing the code THEN components SHALL be properly typed with TypeScript interfaces
6. WHEN reviewing the code THEN components SHALL follow the established project architecture patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the form, I want clear visual feedback and intuitive field organization, so that I can easily understand what information is required and optional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the form THEN contact fields SHALL be visually grouped together
2. WHEN viewing the form THEN the parts quantity field SHALL be clearly labeled and positioned logically
3. WHEN the contact toggle is changed THEN the visual state of contact fields SHALL update immediately
4. WHEN validation errors occur THEN they SHALL be displayed clearly next to the relevant fields
5. WHEN the form is in a loading state THEN all interactive elements SHALL be properly disabled
